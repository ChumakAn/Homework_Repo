# Homework_Repo
My second repository for homework 
In this lab , I created an array of recorded weather in different countries and cities , with additional parameters. Thanks to function findMaxTemperature , so user is able to get to know the maximum temperature on the exact day. Also , I added predictional method if it is similar to weather in Lviv . Additionally , we can sort an aray by days.
In "Weather.h" we have two classes , in "Weather_Source.cpp" we have main function and in "Weather_Resource.cpp" I realized all the functions.
In order to compile the files you have to open them in Visual Studio (and debug).
